# Poly_Collision

A simple Polygon collision detection algorithm implemented using Separated Axis Theorem.

## Getting Started

Polygons are represented as Lists of Points (List<Point>)


Example of using the collision function
<code>
    PolygonCollision.doesOverlap(poly1, poly2);
</code>

Example of using the point in polygon function
<code>
    PolygonCollision.isPointInPolygon(poly, point);
</code>
